    Accepted version (only could make it implementing with cache -  memoization, or lazy strategy - using dictionary ). This was the simplest cache that I have thought about. Tests are a little bit strange, because cache is a variable from Collatz module, so we have to import it too. All "collatz" methods have at least 4 test methods.
